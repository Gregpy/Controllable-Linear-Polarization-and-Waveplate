# Controllable-Linear-Polarization-and-Waveplate
This simulates the polarization of a linearly polarized laser beam going through an adjustable waveplate.

The adjustable values are described in the notebook. The angle of the linearly polarized laser beam can be chosen (lp), the angle of the waveplate (h), and the phase retardation of the waveplate (n). The wavelength of the laser is arbitrary since the wavelength is taken over a full period.
